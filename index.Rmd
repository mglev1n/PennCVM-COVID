### Management

#### Stable/Chronic
+ Goal-directed medical therapy with beta-blockade, ACE/ARB/ARNI, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist
+ [ESC](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang) and [HFSA/ACC/AHA](https://professional.heart.org/professional/ScienceNews/UCM_505836_HFSAACCAHA-statement-addresses-concerns-re-using-RAAS-antagonists-in-COVID-19.jsp) recommend continuation of ACE/ARB/ARNI. See [Medication Considerations]

#### Unstable/Cardiogenic Shock
+ Consider invasive hemodynamic monitoring with arterial and central venous catheters
+ Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25, SVR 800-1000, SCvO2 > 60%, CI > 2.2 (Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then optimize other parameters)
+ Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and antihypertensives are discontinued.
+ Titration of norepinephrine infusion for goal MAP 65-75
+ Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP > 14, PCWP >18, PAD > 25
+ Consider inotropic support (eg. dobutamine or epinephrine infusions)


## Medication Considerations

### ACE/ARB/ARNI

#### Pathophysiology
+ Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into human cells. In animal models, both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression in the heart, raising concern that these medications may increase susceptibility to COVID-19. ([Patel et al., JAMA 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32208485))
+ There is no clinical evidence that ACE/ARB/ARNI are associated with increased risk of COVID-19.
+ Preclinical models have suggested ARBs may attenuate SARS-CoV-induced lung injury ([Kuba, et al., Nature Medicine, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16007097/))

#### Recommendation
+ [ESC](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang) and [HFSA/ACC/AHA](https://professional.heart.org/professional/ScienceNews/UCM_505836_HFSAACCAHA-statement-addresses-concerns-re-using-RAAS-antagonists-in-COVID-19.jsp) recommend continuation of ACE/ARB/ARNI.

### NSAIDs

#### Pathophysiology
+ NSAIDs suppress prostaglandin synthases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), enzymes responsible for producing prostaglandins (lipids which can trigger pain and fever)
+ SARS-CoV-1 binds to the COX-2 promotor, increasing expression of this enzyme ([Yan, et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol., 2006](https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/external-ref?access_num=16546436&link_type=MED&atom=%2Fsci%2F367%2F6485%2F1434.1.atom))
  + PGE2 may inhibit coronavirus replication ([Amici et al., Antivir. Ther., 2006](https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/external-ref?access_num=17302372&link_type=MED&atom=%2Fsci%2F367%2F6485%2F1434.1.atom))
+ Indomethacin may block coronavirus RNA synthesis independent of COX inhibition ([Sander et al., Front. Physiol, 2017](https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/external-ref?access_num=28261111&link_type=MED&atom=%2Fsci%2F367%2F6485%2F1434.1.atom))
+ __Overall:__ NSAIDs and the cyclooxygnase pathway have been implicated mechanistically in both increased and decreased susceptibility to SARS-CoV

#### Recommendation
+ There is no strong clinical evidence _for_ or _against_ the use of NSAIDs in individuals with (or at-risk-of) SARS-CoV-2 infection ([Fitzgerald, Science, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32198292))


### Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine

#### Toxicity
+ __Cardiovascular:__ Atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, ECG changes (including prolonged QRS and QTc intervals, T-wave inversion, or depression), hypotension, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia ([UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chloroquine-drug-information?sectionName=Adult&topicId=9247&search=chloroquine&usage_type=panel&anchor=F149786&source=panel_search_result&selectedTitle=1~114&kp_tab=drug_general&display_rank=1#F3195083))
+ __Ophthalmologic:__ toxicity is uncommon with short-term use; long-term use associated with retinal toxicity

#### Monitoring
+ ECG (baseline QTc)
+ Consider telemetry

### Azithromycin

#### Toxicity
+ __Altered cardiac conduction:__ QTc prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, torsades de pointes; consider avoiding use in patients with prolonged QT interval, congenital long QT syndrome, history of torsades de pointes, bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, uncompensated heart failure, or concurrent use of Class IA (eg, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (eg, amiodarone, dofetilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs known to prolong the QT interval. ([UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-systemic-drug-information?search=azithromycin&source=panel_search_result&selectedTitle=1~146&usage_type=panel&display_rank=1#F7983222))

#### Monitoring
+ ECG (baseline QTc)
+ Consider telemetry
