# Cardiovascular Manifestations of COVID-19  

## Acute Cardiac Injury

### Definition
Serum levels of [cardiac biomarkers][Cardiac Biomarkers] (eg, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I) above the 99th percentile upper reference limit, or new electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities ([Huang, et al., Lancet, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31986264/); [Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32171076/))  

### Pathophysiology
May occur directly as consequence of virus-associated [Acute Coronary Syndrome], [Arrhythmia], [Myo/Pericarditis], or [Cytokine Release][Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release], or indirectly associated with the combination of acute illness and underlying hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, structural heart disease, chronic kidney disease, or diabetes ([Bonow, et al. JAMA Cardiology 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219362); [Thygesen, et al., JACC, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153967))

### Diagnostics
+ [Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP][Cardiac Biomarkers]  
+ [ECG][Electrocardiography/Telemetry]   
+ Consider [limited echocardiogram][Echocardiography]  
+ Consider measurement of inflammatory markers to evaluate hyperinflammation (Ferritin, IL-6, LDH, D-dimer)  

### Incidence
+ 12% overall, 31% ICU, 4% non-ICU (among 41 patients total) ([Huang, et al., Lancet, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31986264/))
+ 17% overall (among 191 patients total) ([Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32171076/))
+ 19.7% overall (among 416 patients overall) ([Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32211816))
+ 27.8% (n = 52) (among 187 patients overall) ([Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020](http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017))

### Prognostic Implications
+ Associated with increased utilization of noninvasive ventilation (38 [46.3%] vs 13 [3.9%]; P < .001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (18 [22.0%] vs 14 [4.2%]; P < .001) ([Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32211816))
+ Associated with increased mortality
  + Occured in 59% of non-survivors (N = 32) vs. 1% of survivors (N = 1) ([Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32171076/))
  + Adjusted HR 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49] p < 0.001) ([Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32211816))
  + Mortality 59.6% (n = 31) in individuals with ↑TnT vs. 8.9% (n = 12) with normal TnT; p < 0.001 ([Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020](http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017))
  + Possible interaction between underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury
    + Mortality 7.62% (8 of 105) among patients without CVD + normal TnT, 13.33% (4 of 30) for underlying CVD + normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD + ↑TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for underlying CVD + ↑TnT ([Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020](http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017))
    
### Treatment Considerations
  + Supportive care
  + If associated with concomittant [hyperinflammation/cytokine storm/secondary HLH][Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release], consider anti-IL6 or anti-IL1 therapy


## Acute Coronary Syndrome

### Definition
+ Acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischemia [(Thygesen, et al., JACC, 2018)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153967)
+ Must be differentiated from other causes of [Acute Cardiac Injury]

### Pathophysiology
+ Myocardial ischemia as a consequence of atherothrombotic coronary artery disease (eg. plaque disruption; Type I MI), mismatch between oxygen supply and demand (Type II MI), in association with cardiac death (eg. Type III MI), related to percutaneous coronary intervention (Type IV MI), or associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (Type V MI)


### Incidence
+ As of 3/2020, case reports of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (Type 1 MI) in the setting of COVID-19 have yet to be published ([Driggin, et al., JACC, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32201335)) 
+ Severe respiratory has been identified as a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction 
  + Incidence ratio [IR] 6.1, 95% CI 3.9-9.5 following influenza; IR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2–6.2 following non-influenza viral illness ([Kwong, et al., NEJM, 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29365305/))

+ VT/VF in 5.9% (n = 11) ([Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020](http://jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?doi=10.1001/jamacardio.2020.1017))
+ Palpitations in 7.2% (n = 10) ([Liu, et al., Chinese Medical Journal, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32044814))

### Diagnostics
+ BMP, magnesium, TSH
+ [ECG][Electrocardiography/Telemetry]
+ [Telemetry][Electrocardiography/Telemetry]
+ Consider [limited echocardiogram][Echocardiography]  

### Treatment Considerations

## Myo/Pericarditis

### Incidence
+ Myocarditis and pericarditis may be sources of acute cardiac injury based on case reports, overall incidence unclear ([Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med, 2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32125452); [Zeng et al, Preprints, 2020](http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202003.0180.v1); [Hu et al, Eur Heart J, 2020](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32176300); [Inciardi, et al., JAMA Cardiology 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32219357))
+ No clear evidence of myocarditis on limited cardiac biopsy [(Xu, et al., Lancet Respir Med, 2020)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32085846)

### Clinical Presentation
Myo/Pericarditis may present with a broad spectrum and severity of symptoms including chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia/bradycardia, elevated cardiac biomarkers, or acute-onset heart failure with cardiogenic shock.  

### Diagnostics
+ [Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP][Cardiac Biomarkers]
+ Physical exam may demonstrate pericardial friction rub, signs of heart failure (S3, elevated jugular venous pressure, edema)
+ [ECG][Electrocardiography/Telemetry] - case reports of pseudo-STEMI manifestations
  + Diffuse ST-segment elevation with PR-segment depression
+ Consider [limited echocardiogram][Echocardiography]  
+ Unclear role of endomyocardial biopsy (to evaluate direct viral effects) and/or cardiac MRI/CT (to evaluate for myocardial inflammation and the presence of underlying coronary artery disease)

### Management
+ Supportive treatment
  + __Acute Heart Failure:__ avoid medications with negative chronotropic/inotropic effects (eg. beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers) if concerned for new heart failure as cardiac output may be dependent on tachycardia; avoid NSAIDs which may lead to fluid retention and myocardial injury. See [Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock].
  + __Arrhythmia:__ see [Arrhythmia]
  + __Pericarditis without myocardial involvement:__ consider colchicine, NSAIDs
+ Consider anti-inflammatory/immunomodulators if concomittant [Cytokine Release][Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release]; Anecdotal/case reports describe treatment with steroids and IVIG

## Thromboembolic Disease/Coagulopathy

+ Coagulopathy present in 50% (n = 27) of non-survivors vs. 7% (n = 10) in survivors (p <0.001) ([Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32171076/))  
+ Disseminated intravascular coagulation present in 71.4% (n = 15) of non-survivors vs. 0.6% (n = 1) in survivors ([Tang, et al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32073213))

### Treatment Considerations
+ VTE prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19
+ A retrospective study in China of 449 consecutive cases of severe COVID-19 showed benefit of LMWH in patients with high D-Dimer, PT times, and Sepsis Induced Coagulopathy score > 4 ([Tang, et al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32220112)) 
+ Current ISTH proposed guidelines suggest prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH ([Thachil et al, Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14810))

### Management

#### Stable/Chronic
+ Goal-directed medical therapy with beta-blockade, ACE/ARB/ARNI, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist
+ [ESC](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang) and [HFSA/ACC/AHA](https://professional.heart.org/professional/ScienceNews/UCM_505836_HFSAACCAHA-statement-addresses-concerns-re-using-RAAS-antagonists-in-COVID-19.jsp) recommend continuation of ACE/ARB/ARNI. See [Cardiovascular Medication Considerations]

#### Unstable/Cardiogenic Shock
+ Consider invasive hemodynamic monitoring with arterial and central venous catheters
+ Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25, SVR 800-1000, SCvO2 > 60%, CI > 2.2 (Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then optimize other parameters)
+ Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and antihypertensives are discontinued.
+ Titration of norepinephrine infusion for goal MAP 65-75
+ Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP > 14, PCWP >18, PAD > 25
+ Consider inotropic support (eg. dobutamine or epinephrine infusions)


# Cardiovascular Testing Considerations

## Electrocardiography/Telemetry

### Indications
+ Evaluate COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications, including [Acute Cardiac Injury], [Acute Coronary Syndrome], [Arrhythmia], [Myo/Pericarditis], cardiac injury related to [Cytokine Release][Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release], or [Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock]  
+ Monitor for medication toxicity associated with COVID-19 treatment (see [Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine] and [Azithromycin]) 
+ Evaluate non-COVID-19 associated acute/chronic manifestations of cardiovascular disease

### Recommendations
+ Obtain baseline electrocardiogram in all patients diagnosed with COVID-19
+ Repeat electrocardiogram if new concern for cardiovascular complication
+ Consider utilization of telemetry to minimize need for serial/frequent electrocardiograms which require significant close bedside contact


## Echocardiography

### Indications
Echocardiography may be employed to evaluate COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications, including [Acute Cardiac Injury], [Acute Coronary Syndrome], [Arrhythmia], [Myo/Pericarditis], cardiac injury related to [Cytokine Release][Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release], or [Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock], or non-COVID-19 associated acute/chronic manifestations of cardiovascular disease.

### Special Considerations
+ To limit potential exposure of sonographers and providers, limited echocardiograms are preferred, and when possible point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) should be considered for initial evaluation.  
+ Transesophageal echocardiography in particular is a potentially aerosolizing procedure, exposing staff to a high level of risk. When possible, alternative lower-risk modalities can be considered (eg. cardiac CT for evaluation of left atrial appendage thrombus). 
+ At UPHS, the intensive care units are equipped with in-room video cameras, enabling sonographers and cardiologists to guide point-of-care echocardiogram image acquisition and interpretation in real-time. See sample workflow below:

## Cardiac Biomarkers

Cardiac biomarkers in general refer to troponin, however in specific clincal circumstances may include measurement of creatine kinase and subfractions and/or BNP/NT-proBNP (eg. evaluation of [Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock]).

### Indications
+ Evaluate COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications, including [Acute Cardiac Injury], [Acute Coronary Syndrome], [Myo/Pericarditis], cardiac injury related to [Cytokine Release][Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release], or [Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock] 
+ Provide prognostic information about COVID-19 progression and survival (see [Acute Cardiac Injury])
+ Evaluate non-COVID-19 associated acute/chronic manifestations of cardiovascular disease

### Recommendations
+ Obtain baseline troponin in all patients diagnosed with COVID-19  
  + Consider serial evaluation every 2-3 days in hospitalized patients for prognostic purposes  
+ Repeat cardiac biomarker testing if concern for new cardiovascular complication  
  + Follow institution-specific guidelines with regard to frequency and duration of testing for evaluation of conditions like [Acute Coronary Syndrome] or [Cardiomyopathy][Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock], which may depend on available testing (eg. high-sensitivity troponin, troponin-T vs. troponin-I, BNP vs. NT-proBNP, etc.)
  + Rate-of-change may be useful in differentiating [Acute Coronary Syndrome] from other etologies of [Acute Cardiac Injury] (eg. secondary to [Myo/Pericarditis]
 or [Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock])

# General Management Considerations

Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 should undergo [risk assessment][Risk Stratification] to estimate progression to severe disease. Risk assessment may inform need for additional testing and guide treatment, including establishing elegibility for clinical trials.

## Risk Stratification

Many risk factors for severe disease have been identified from observational data, although most are non-specific and can occur separately from COVID-19 disease ([Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32171076/)). UPHS has identified several risk factors that may be associated with increased risk. Any single risk factor below may confer increased risk of progression to severe disease: 

+ __Epidemiologic:__ Age >55, pre-existing pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, history of hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, use of immunosuppresion/biologic medications, uncontrolled HIV (CD4 < 200), history of organ transplant, actively treated malignancy, BMI > 40
+ __Vital Signs:__ Respiratory rate >24 breaths/minute, heart rate >125 beats/minute, SpO2 < 90% on room air
+ __Labs:__ D-dimer >1000ng/ml, CPK >2x upper limit of normal, non-cardiac CRP >100, LDH >245 U/L, elevated troponin, admission absolute lymphocyte count < 0.8, ferritin >300 ug/L (>800 ug/L associated with increased risk of mortality), higher SOFA Score

See [Cardiovascular Testing Considerations] for recommendations regarding indications and frequency of cardiology-specific testing

# Cardiovascular Medication Considerations

## ACE/ARB/ARNI

See reviews: [Vaduganathan et al., NEJM, 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsr2005760) and [Patel et al., JAMA 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32208485)

### Pathophysiology
+ Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into human cells
+ ACE2 is expressed in many tissues, including in the heart and kidneys, and lung alveolar epithelial cells ([Hamming, et al., J Pathol, 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15141377))
  + Under normal conditions lung ACE2 expression is low ([Serfozo, Hypertension, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31786979)), but may be upregulated in infection
+ Pharmacologic modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may alter ACE2 levels
  + ACE inhibitors in humans _do not_ appear to affect ACE2 _activity._ These drugs specifically target ACE, which has a different active site than ACE2 ([Rice, et al., Biochem J, 2004](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15283675))

### Potential Harms
+ There is conflicting evidence, but in some animal models, both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression in the heart, raising concern that these medications may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 through increased SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. ([Patel et al., JAMA 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32208485))

### Potential Benefits
+ Withdrawal of ACE/ARB and other goal-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure is associated with worsening symptoms ([Pflugfelder, et al., JACC, 1993](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8227822); [Halliday, et al., Lancet, 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30429050))
+ Early initiation of ACE-inhbitors following myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome is associated with improved outcomes ([Circulation, 1998](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9631869))
+ Currently, there is no clinical evidence that ACE/ARB/ARNI are associated with increased risk of COVID-19.
+ Preclinical models have suggested ARBs may attenuate SARS-CoV-induced lung injury ([Kuba, et al., Nature Medicine, 2005](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16007097/))

### Recommendation
+ [ESC](https://www.escardio.org/Councils/Council-on-Hypertension-(CHT)/News/position-statement-of-the-esc-council-on-hypertension-on-ace-inhibitors-and-ang) and [HFSA/ACC/AHA](https://professional.heart.org/professional/ScienceNews/UCM_505836_HFSAACCAHA-statement-addresses-concerns-re-using-RAAS-antagonists-in-COVID-19.jsp) recommend continuation of ACE/ARB/ARNI.

## NSAIDs

### Pathophysiology
+ NSAIDs suppress prostaglandin synthases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), enzymes responsible for producing prostaglandins (lipids which can trigger pain and fever)

### Potential Harms
+ SARS-CoV-1 binds to the COX-2 promotor, increasing expression of this enzyme. ([Yan, et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol., 2006](https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/external-ref?access_num=16546436&link_type=MED&atom=%2Fsci%2F367%2F6485%2F1434.1.atom)). Because PGE2 may inhibit coronavirus replication ([Amici et al., Antivir. Ther., 2006](https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/external-ref?access_num=17302372&link_type=MED&atom=%2Fsci%2F367%2F6485%2F1434.1.atom)), there is theoretical concern that NSAID-mediated decreases in PGE2 may increase risk of COVID-19.
+ NSAIDs may increase risk of cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal ulcer/bleeding, and acute kidney injury, among others

### Potential Benefits
+ Indomethacin may block coronavirus RNA synthesis independent of COX inhibition ([Sander et al., Front. Physiol, 2017](https://science.sciencemag.org/lookup/external-ref?access_num=28261111&link_type=MED&atom=%2Fsci%2F367%2F6485%2F1434.1.atom))

### Recommendation
+ There is no strong clinical evidence _for_ or _against_ the use of NSAIDs in individuals with (or at-risk-of) SARS-CoV-2 infection ([Fitzgerald, Science, 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32198292)), although other patient-specific factors (risk of cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal ulcers/bleeding, chronic kidney disease) should be considered.


## Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine

See review: [Simpson, et al., ACC.org, 2020](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/27/14/00/ventricular-arrhythmia-risk-due-to-hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin-treatment-for-covid-19) 

### Toxicity
+ __Cardiovascular:__ Atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, ECG changes (including prolonged QRS and QTc intervals, T-wave inversion, or depression), hypotension, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia ([UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chloroquine-drug-information?sectionName=Adult&topicId=9247&search=chloroquine&usage_type=panel&anchor=F149786&source=panel_search_result&selectedTitle=1~114&kp_tab=drug_general&display_rank=1#F3195083))
+ __Ophthalmologic:__ toxicity is uncommon with short-term use; long-term use associated with retinal toxicity

### Monitoring
+ [ECG][Electrocardiography/Telemetry] (baseline QTc)
+ Consider telemetry

## Azithromycin

See review: [Simpson, et al., ACC.org, 2020](https://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2020/03/27/14/00/ventricular-arrhythmia-risk-due-to-hydroxychloroquine-azithromycin-treatment-for-covid-19) 

### Toxicity
+ __Altered cardiac conduction:__ QTc prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, torsades de pointes; consider avoiding use in patients with prolonged QT interval, congenital long QT syndrome, history of torsades de pointes, bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, uncompensated heart failure, or concurrent use of Class IA (eg, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (eg, amiodarone, dofetilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs known to prolong the QT interval. ([UpToDate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/azithromycin-systemic-drug-information?search=azithromycin&source=panel_search_result&selectedTitle=1~146&usage_type=panel&display_rank=1#F7983222))

### Monitoring
+ [ECG][Electrocardiography/Telemetry] (baseline QTc)
+ Consider telemetry
