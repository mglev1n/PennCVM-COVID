JAMA Cardiology 2020; Thygesen, et al., JACC, 2018) Diagnostics Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP ECG Consider limited echocardiogram Consider measurement of inflammatory markers to evaluate hyperinflammation (Ferritin, IL-6, LDH, D-dimer) Incidence 12% overall, 31% ICU, 4% non-ICU (among 41 patients total) (Huang, et al., Lancet, 2020) 17% overall (among 191 patients total) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) 19.7% overall (among 416 patients overall) (Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) 27.8% (n = 52) (among 187 patients overall) (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Prognostic Implications Associated with increased utilization of noninvasive ventilation (38 [46.3%] vs 13 [3.9%]; P &lt; .001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (18 [22.0%] vs 14 [4.2%]; P &lt; .001) (Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Associated with increased mortality Occured in 59% of non-survivors (N = 32) vs. 1% of survivors (N = 1) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Adjusted HR 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49] p &lt; 0.001) (Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Mortality 59.6% (n = 31) in individuals with ↑TnT vs. 8.9% (n = 12) with normal TnT; p &lt; 0.001 (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Increased mortality was seen with elevated troponin regardless of CVD status, but underlying CVD was also associated with increased mortality without evidence of cardiac injury Mortality 7.62% (8 of 105) among patients without CVD + normal TnT, 13.33% (4 of 30) for underlying CVD + normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD + ↑TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for underlying CVD + ↑TnT (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Treatment Considerations Supportive care If associated with concomitant hyperinflammation/cytokine storm/secondary HLH, consider anti-IL6 or anti-IL1 therapy Acute Coronary Syndrome Definition Acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischemia (Thygesen, et al., JACC, 2018) Must be differentiated from other causes of Acute Cardiac Injury Pathophysiology Myocardial ischemia as a consequence of atherothrombotic coronary artery disease (eg. plaque disruption; Type I MI), mismatch between oxygen supply and demand (Type II MI), in association with cardiac death (eg. Type III MI), related to percutaneous coronary intervention (Type IV MI), or associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (Type V MI) Incidence As of 3/2020, case reports of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (Type 1 MI) in the setting of COVID-19 have yet to be published (Driggin, et al., JACC, 2020) Severe respiratory infection has been identified as a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction Incidence ratio [IR] 6.1, 95% CI 3.9-9.5 following influenza; IR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2–6.2 following non-influenza viral illness (Kwong, et al., NEJM, 2018) Diagnostics Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, lipid screen, A1c ECG Consider limited echocardiogram Treatment Considerations (SCAI Guidelines) See Szerlip, et al., Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions, 2020, summarized below: STEMI Primary PCI for high risk patients (anterior location, hypotension, elevated Killip class, cardiogenic shock, life-threatening, delayed presentation &gt;12 hours) Consider fibrinolysis for low risk patients without contraindications (intracranial hemorrhage, prior stroke, recent trauma/surgery, intracranial malignancy/arteriovenous malformation/aneurysm, active bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension); otherwise consider primary PCI or medical management NSTEMI Early angiography (&lt;2 hours) for very high risk patients (refractory chest pain, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, life-threatening arrhythmia) Conservative management for non-very high risk patients with antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation (48 hours), high-intensity statin, beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor (if indicated) Arrhythmia Incidence 16.7% overall (n = 23/138); 44% of patients transferred to ICU (n = 16/36) (Wang, et al., JAMA, 2020) VT/VF in 5.9% (n = 11/187) (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Elevated troponin levels at baseline were associated with increased in-hospital VT/VF (17.3% vs. 2%, P&lt;0.001) Palpitations in 7.2% (n = 10) (Liu, et al., Chinese Medical Journal, 2020) Diagnostics BMP, magnesium, TSH ECG Telemetry Consider limited echocardiogram Treatment Considerations Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter No hypotension/shock: Beta blockade and/or calcium-channel blockade Hypotension/shock: Consider amiodarone infusion Ventricular Tachycardia Pulseless/Unstable: ACLS, defibrillation/cardioversion Stable: Consider amiodarone or lidocaine infusion Consider stopping QTc prolonging medications in patients who develop torsades in the setting of prolonged QT Bradyarrhythmia Consider epinephrine, dopamine, isoproteronol, temporary pacemaker Myo/Pericarditis Incidence Myocarditis and pericarditis may be sources of acute cardiac injury based on case reports, overall incidence unclear (Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med, 2020; Zeng et al, Preprints, 2020; Hu et al, Eur Heart J, 2020; Inciardi, et al., JAMA Cardiology 2020) No clear evidence of myocarditis on limited cardiac biopsy (Xu, et al., Lancet Respir Med, 2020), but case reports have demonstrated evidence of myocarditis on MRI (Inciardi et al., JAMA Cardiology 2020) Clinical Presentation Myo/Pericarditis may present with a broad spectrum and severity of symptoms including chest pain, palpitations, tachycardia/bradycardia, elevated cardiac biomarkers, or acute-onset heart failure with cardiogenic shock. Diagnostics Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, Ferritin, IL-6, LDH, D-dimer Physical exam may demonstrate pericardial friction rub, signs of heart failure (S3, elevated jugular venous pressure, edema) ECG - case reports of pseudo-STEMI manifestations Diffuse ST-segment elevation with PR-segment depression Consider limited echocardiogram Unclear role of endomyocardial biopsy (to evaluate direct viral effects) and/or cardiac MRI/CT (to evaluate for myocardial inflammation and the presence of underlying coronary artery disease) Management Supportive treatment Acute Heart Failure: avoid medications with negative chronotropic/inotropic effects (eg. beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers) if concerned for new heart failure as cardiac output may be dependent on tachycardia; avoid NSAIDs which may lead to fluid retention and myocardial injury. See Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock. Arrhythmia: see Arrhythmia Pericarditis without myocardial involvement: consider colchicine, NSAIDs Consider anti-inflammatory/immunomodulators if concomittant Cytokine Release; Anecdotal/case reports describe treatment with steroids and IVIG Thromboembolic Disease/Coagulopathy Incidence Mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 100-150) in 20% (n = 13) (Fan, et al., American Journal of Hematology, 2020) Coagulopathy in 34.1% (n = 42) (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Coagulopathy (defined as 3-second extension of PT or a 5-second extension of aPTT) in 19% (n = 37) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Diagnostics CBC with differential, D-dimer, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, peripheral smear Prognostic Implications Elevated D-dimer levels (&gt;1g/L) associated with in-hospital death (adjusted OR 18.4 95% CI 2.6-128.6, p=0.003) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Coagulopathy present in 50% (n = 27) of non-survivors vs. 7% (n = 10) in survivors (p &lt;0.001) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Disseminated intravascular coagulation present in 71.4% (n = 15) of non-survivors vs. 0.6% (n = 1) in survivors (Tang, et al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020) Treatment Considerations VTE prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 A retrospective study in China of 449 consecutive cases of severe COVID-19 showed benefit of LMWH (mainly prophylactic dose) in patients with high D-Dimer, PT times, and Sepsis Induced Coagulopathy score &gt; 4 (Tang, et al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020) Current ISTH proposed guidelines suggest prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH (Thachil et al, Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020) Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release Definition Hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by macrophage activation and fulminant hypercytokinemia, associated with multiorgan failure and shock. Clinical Presentation Fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, and hyperferritinemia, with progression to ARDS in 54% (Seguin, et al., Chest, 2016) May be associated with Acute Cardiac Injury (Zheng, et al., Nat Rev Cardiol, 2020) Incidence Unclear incidence/prevalence in COVID-19, although a similar pattern of dysregulated immune response has been reported (Mehta et al, Lancet, 2020) Similar response identified in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS infections (Kim et al, J Korean Med Sci, 2016) Occurs in 3.7-4.3% of patients with sepsis (Karakike, et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2020) Diagnostics CBC with differential, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, hepatic function panel, triglycerides, inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP/ferritin/LDH); consider NK-function, soluble IL-2 receptor in discussion with hematology/oncology Calculate H-score (MDcalc) Prognostic Implications Associated with rapid progression to ARDS, shock, and multiorgan failure (Chen et al, Lancet, 2020) Treatment Considerations Care typically supportive Consideration of IVIG, steroids (may be associated with worsened lung injury), enrollment in clinical trial (or off-label use) of cytokine blockade (IL-6 antagonists [eg. tocilizumab, sarilumab, siltuximab] or IL-1 antagonists [eg. anakinra]) Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock Incidence 23% overall (n = 44/191) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) 33% (n = 7/21) of ICU patients in Washington State (Arentz et al., JAMA, 2020) There are limited reports of fulminant cardiomyopathy and cardiogenic shock Diagnostics Physical Exam: ↑JVP/CVP, edema, rales/crackles Pulse pressure &lt; 25% of SBP correlates highly with cardiac index &lt; 2.2 (sensitivity 91%, specificity 83%) (Stevenson and Perloff, JAMA, 1989) Labs: Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, lactate, central/mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2) if available; consider evaluation of Cytokine Release with Inflammatory Biomarkers ECG Chest x-ray Consider limited echocardiogram For patients with cardiogenic shock, echocardiogram may help differentiate the etiology and change management (eg. global hypokinesis vs. regional wall abnormality suggesting ACS, mechanical complications of an untreated MI) Prognostic Implications Chronic heart failure associated with increased risk of acute cardiac injury (14.6% vs. 1.5%) (Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Associated with increased risk of mortality, more common in non-survivors (52%, n = 28) vs. survivors (12%, n = 16) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Management Stable/Chronic Goal-directed medical therapy with beta-blockade, ACE/ARB/ARNI, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ESC and HFSA/ACC/AHA recommend continuation of ACE/ARB/ARNI. See Cardiovascular Medication Considerations Unstable/Cardiogenic Shock Consider invasive hemodynamic monitoring with arterial and central venous catheters Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25, SVR 800-1000, SCvO2 &gt; 60%, CI &gt; 2.2 (Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then optimize other parameters) Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and antihypertensives are discontinued. Titration of norepinephrine infusion for goal MAP 65-75 Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP &gt; 14, PCWP &gt;18, PAD &gt; 25 Consider inotropic support (eg. dobutamine or epinephrine infusions) Consider bedside placement of IABP or ECMO if patients are not responding to medical management alone "],

Special Considerations To limit potential exposure of sonographers and providers, limited echocardiograms are preferred, and when possible point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) should be considered for initial evaluation. Transesophageal echocardiography in particular is a potentially aerosolizing procedure, exposing staff to a high level of risk. When possible, alternative lower-risk modalities can be considered (eg. cardiac CT for evaluation of left atrial appendage thrombus). At UPHS, the intensive care units are equipped with in-room video cameras, enabling sonographers and cardiologists to guide point-of-care echocardiogram image acquisition and interpretation in real-time. See sample workflow below: Sample Workflow Cardiac Biomarkers Cardiac biomarkers in general refer to troponin, however in specific clinical circumstances may include measurement of creatine kinase and subfractions and/or BNP/NT-proBNP (eg. evaluation of Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock). Indications Evaluate COVID-19-associated cardiovascular complications, including Acute Cardiac Injury, Acute Coronary Syndrome, Myo/Pericarditis, cardiac injury related to Cytokine Release, or Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock Provide prognostic information about COVID-19 progression and survival (see Acute Cardiac Injury) Evaluate non-COVID-19 associated acute/chronic manifestations of cardiovascular disease Recommendations Consider baseline troponin in all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 for risk stratification Consider serial evaluation every 2-3 days in hospitalized patients for prognostic purposes Repeat cardiac biomarker testing if concern for new cardiovascular complication or clinical decompensation Follow institution-specific guidelines with regard to frequency and duration of testing for evaluation of conditions like Acute Coronary Syndrome or Cardiomyopathy, which may depend on available testing (eg. high-sensitivity troponin, troponin-T vs. troponin-I, BNP vs. NT-proBNP, etc.) Rate-of-change may be useful in differentiating Acute Coronary Syndrome from other etiologies of Acute Cardiac Injury (eg. secondary to Myo/Pericarditis or Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock) Coagulation Biomarkers Typically includes CBC with differential, PT/INR, aPTT, D-dimer, fibrinogen; consider blood smear Indications Evaluate COVID-19-associated Thromboembolic Disease/Coagulopathy Provide prognostic information about COVID-19 progression and survival (see Thromboembolic Disease/Coagulopathy) Evaluate non-COVID-19-associated thromboembolic/hematologic disease (eg. deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, coagulopathy, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hemolysis) Recommendations Consider baseline D-dimer, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen for initial risk stratification Consider serial evaluation every 2-3 days in hospitalized patients for prognostic purposes Repeat testing if concern for new complication Inflammatory Biomarkers May include ferritin, non-cardiac CRP, ESR, LDH; under specific circumstances molecular testing of inflammatory cytokine levels may be indicated (if available) Indications Evaluate COVID-19-associated Cytokine Release Provide prognostic information about disease progression and survival May provide information about eligibility for clinical trials Recommendations Consider baseline ferritin, non-cardiac CRP, ESR, LDH for risk stratification Consider serial evaluation every 2-3 days in hospitalized patients for prognostic purposes Consider molecular testing of inflammatory cytokines/markers (eg. IL-6), natural killer cell activity, soluble IL-2 receptor) in discussion with hematology if concerned for Cytokine Release Deferral of Non-urgent Testing/Procedures This section provides guidance from the ACC regarding non-urgent cardiovascular testing and procedures that may be deferred, by specialty.

["risk-stratification.html", "Risk Stratification", " Risk Stratification Individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 should undergo assessment to estimate progression to severe disease. Risk assessment may inform the need for additional testing and guide treatment, including establishing eligibility for clinical trials. Many risk factors for severe disease have been identified from observational data, although most are non-specific and can occur separately from COVID-19 disease (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020). UPHS has identified several risk factors that may be associated with increased risk. Any single risk factor below may confer increased risk of progression to severe disease: Epidemiologic: Age &gt;55, pre-existing pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, history of hypertension, history of cardiovascular disease, use of immunosuppression/biologic medications, uncontrolled HIV (CD4 &lt; 200), history of organ transplant, actively treated malignancy, BMI &gt; 40 Vital Signs: Respiratory rate &gt;24 breaths/minute, heart rate &gt;125 beats/minute, SpO2 &lt; 90% on room air Labs: D-dimer &gt;1000ng/ml, CPK &gt;2x upper limit of normal, non-cardiac CRP &gt;100, LDH &gt;245 U/L, elevated troponin, admission absolute lymphocyte count &lt; 0.8, ferritin &gt;300 ug/L (&gt;800 ug/L associated with increased risk of mortality), higher SOFA Score See Cardiovascular Testing Considerations for recommendations regarding indications and frequency of cardiology-specific testing "],
["general-medication-considerations.html", "General Medication Considerations Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine Remdesivir Lopinavir-Ritonavir IL-6 inhibitors/Immunomodulators Convalescent Serum/Plasma Antibiotics Post-Exposure Prophylaxis", " General Medication Considerations Currently there are no approved treatments specifically for COVID-19, although several clinical trials of investigational therapies are underway. Hydroxychloroquine/Chloroquine Mechanism Antimalarial medication with several proposed antiviral properties (Wang, et al., Cell Res., 2020; Colson, et al., Int J Antimicrob Agents, 2020) Alkylization of the phagosome, inhibiting pH-dependent steps viral replication including infusion and uncoating Glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV-2 Evidence In-vitro studies demonstrate potent inhibition of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 (Yao, et al., Clin Infect Dis, 2020; Devaux, et al., Int J Antimicrob Agents, 2020) Human clinical trials (alone or in combination with azithromycin) have been promising, although are limited by poor trial design and incomplete reporting of prespecified outcomes (Gautret, et al., Int J Antimicrob Agents, 2020; Chen, et al., medRxiv, 2020) Recommendations UPHS guidelines recommend consideration of hydroxychloroquine in hospitalized patients with risk factors for progression to severe disease, and critically-ill patients, including those requiring mechanical ventilation Remdesivir Mechanism Nucleoside analogue that interferes with RNA polymerase, inhibiting viral transcription (Agostini, mBio, 2020) Evidence In vitro evidence of activity against Ebola virus, Marburg, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, RSV, Nipah virus and Hendra virus Several ongoing clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov) Recommendations UPHS guidelines recommend consideration of clinical trial enrollment and are actively seeking/screening patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular testing Lopinavir-Ritonavir Mechanism HIV protease inhibitor (lopinavir) combined with P450 inhibitor (ritonavir) to increase half life Evidence Randomized, controlled, open-label trial from China did not find significant evidence of clinical benefit compared to standard care, among 199 participants with severe COVID-19 (Cao, et al., NEJM, 2020) Treatment group had shorter ICU length of stay (6 vs. 11 days) Treatment group had shorter time to discharge (12 vs. 14 days) following randomization Recommendations UPHS guidelines recommend consideration in critically-ill patients IL-6 inhibitors/Immunomodulators Mechanism The primary immunomodulatory approach to treating COVID-19 has employed humanized monoclonal antibodies to IL-6 to treat complications related to cytokine release syndrome Evidence Tocilizumab currently indicated for treatment of cytokine release syndrome in the setting of chimeric antigen T-cell receptor therapy for leukemia/lymphoma (Grupp, et al., NEJM, 2013; Frey and Porter, Biol Blood Marrow Transplant, 2019) In a retrospective study of 21 Chinese patients (17 severe, 4 critical) treated with tocilizumab 400mg x1 in addition to “standard of care” (including methylprednisolone and lopinavir), 19/21 were discharged including 2 critically-ill patients (Xu et al., ChinaXiv 2020) In a retrospective study of 21 Italian patients treated with siltuximab, CRP levels improved among 16 patients with available data, 7/21 patients improved clinically, 9/21 stabilized, and 5/21 worsened (with 1 death and 1 stroke) (Gritti, et al., medRxiv, 2020) Multiple randomized controlled trials of tocilizumab, sarilumab, and siltuximab are currently enrolling/in progress (ClinicalTrials.gov) Recommendations Consider enrollment in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov) Convalescent Serum/Plasma Form of passive immunotherapy which involves the administration of serum/plasma (obtained via apheresis) containing neutralizing antibodies from patients who have recovered from infection Mechanism May accelerate viral clearance and limit entry into host target cells Evidence Administration of convalescent sera has been attempted in non-randomized trials during outbreaks of other infectious diseases, including H1N1 influenza, SARS, MERS, and Ebola with varying but promising efficacy (Cheng, et al., Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis , 2005; Casadevall, et al., J Clin Invest, 2020; Leider, et al., Transfusion, 2020) Small case series from China of 5 patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma demonstrated improvement in body temperature, SOFA score, viral loads, and need for mechanical ventilation (Shen, et al., JAMA 2020) Recommendations Consider enrollment in a clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov) Antibiotics Rates of bacterial co-infection among patients with COVID-19 remain poorly defined, although one study identified 16% of participants (11/68) with secondary infection (Ruan, et al., Intensive Care Med, 2020) Recommendations If concern exists for bacterial co-infection, evaluation may include sputum culture, MRSA culture, blood and/or urine cultures, procalcitonin, and evaluation with diagnostic imaging Consider empiric treatment for bacterial pneumonia (particularly ventilator associated pneumonia) with antibiotics based on local treatment guidelines and risk factors for drug-resistant organisms (MRSA, pseudomonas) Post-Exposure Prophylaxis Clinical trials are ongoing to investigate the role of antiviral medications in prevention of disease following exposure (eg. hydroxychloroquine post-exposure prophylaxis trial) "],
["cardiovascular-medication-considerations.html", "Cardiovascular Medication Considerations ACE/ARB/ARNI NSAIDs Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine Azithromycin Statins", " Cardiovascular Medication Considerations ACE/ARB/ARNI See reviews: Vaduganathan et al., NEJM, 2020 and Patel et al., JAMA 2020 Pathophysiology Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into human cells ACE2 is expressed in many tissues, including in the heart and kidneys, and lung alveolar epithelial cells (Hamming, et al., J Pathol, 2004) Under normal conditions lung ACE2 expression is low (Serfozo, Hypertension, 2020), but may be upregulated in infection Pharmacologic modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may alter ACE2 levels ACE inhibitors in humans do not appear to affect ACE2 activity. These drugs specifically target ACE, which has a different active site than ACE2 (Rice, et al., Biochem J, 2004) Potential Harms There is conflicting evidence, but in some animal models, both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression in the heart, raising concern that these medications may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 through increased SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. (Patel et al., JAMA 2020) Potential Benefits Withdrawal of ACE/ARB and other goal-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure is associated with worsening symptoms (Pflugfelder, et al., JACC, 1993; Halliday, et al., Lancet, 2019) Early initiation of ACE-inhibitors following myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome is associated with improved outcomes (Circulation, 1998) Currently, there is no clinical evidence that ACE/ARB/ARNI are associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Preclinical models have suggested ARBs may attenuate SARS-CoV-induced lung injury (Kuba, et al., Nature Medicine, 2005) Recommendation ESC and HFSA/ACC/AHA recommend continuation of ACE/ARB/ARNI. NSAIDs Pathophysiology NSAIDs suppress prostaglandin synthases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), enzymes responsible for producing prostaglandins (lipids which can trigger pain and fever) Potential Harms SARS-CoV-1 binds to the COX-2 promoter, increasing expression of this enzyme. (Yan, et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol., 2006). Because PGE2 may inhibit coronavirus replication (Amici et al., Antivir. Ther., 2006), there is theoretical concern that NSAID-mediated decreases in PGE2 may increase risk of COVID-19. NSAIDs may increase risk of cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal ulcer/bleeding, and acute kidney injury, among others Potential Benefits Indomethacin may block coronavirus RNA synthesis independent of COX inhibition (Sander et al., Front. Physiol, 2017) Recommendation There is no strong clinical evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs in individuals with (or at-risk-of) SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fitzgerald, Science, 2020), although other patient-specific factors (risk of cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal ulcers/bleeding, chronic kidney disease) should be considered. Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine See review: Simpson, et al., ACC.org, 2020 Toxicity Cardiovascular: Atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, ECG changes (including prolonged QRS and QTc intervals, T-wave inversion, or depression), hypotension, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (UpToDate) Development of acute renal failure (but not baseline QTc) predictive of developing prolonged QTc &gt;500ms among patients being treated for SARS-CoV-2 infection with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin at New York University (Chorin, et al., medRxiv, 2020) Ophthalmologic: toxicity is uncommon with short-term use; long-term use associated with retinal toxicity Monitoring ECG (baseline QTc) Consider telemetry Azithromycin See review: Simpson, et al., ACC.org, 2020 Toxicity Altered cardiac conduction: QTc prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, torsades de pointes; consider avoiding use in patients with prolonged QT interval, congenital long QT syndrome, history of torsades de pointes, bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, decompensated heart failure, or concurrent use of Class IA (eg, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (eg, amiodarone, dofetilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs known to prolong the QT interval. (UpToDate) Development of acute renal failure (but not baseline QTc) predictive of developing prolonged QTc &gt;500ms among patients being treated for SARS-CoV-2 infection with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin at New York University (Chorin, et al., medRxiv, 2020) Monitoring ECG (baseline QTc) Consider telemetry Statins Potential Benefits Statins may have an anti-inflammatory effect that blunts the immune response to acute viral infection (Virani, ACC.org, 2020) In preclinical models, statins upregulate ACE2 (Tikoo, et al., Bichem Pharmacol, 2015) - downregulation of ACE2 has been observed in ARDS, and restoring ACE2 levels may be a novel treatment strategy (Wosten-van Aspersen, et al., Pediatr Crit Care Med, 2013). Recommendations Overall, there is insufficient evidence to recommend initiation of statns soley for treatment of COVID-19 and/or ARDS Statins should be continued in patients previously prescribed statins Initiation of statins should be considered for patients with other indiciations (eg. known coronary artery disease, stroke, peripheral artery disease, diabetes, elevated 10-year risk of ASCVD) "],
["respiratory-considerations.html", "Respiratory Considerations Incidence of Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Basics of Mechanical Ventilation Hemodynamic Effects of Mechanical Ventilation", " Respiratory Considerations Hypoxia is a common lower respiratory manifestation of COVID-19, particularly among hospitalized patients, often with progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Modalities to provide supplemental oxygenation and ventilation have consequences on the cardiovascular system, particularly among patients with underlying cardiovascular disease. Strategies for use of non-invasive and invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID may be institution-specific based on equipement availability and staff expertise, in addition to COVID-specific considerations including expected disease trajectory and risks of aerosolization. The need for supplemental oxygenation/ventilation, basic management, and the hemodynamic consequences are reviewed here. See Avilar, et al., JACC 2018 Incidence of Hypoxic Respiratory Failure Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the need for supplemental oxygenation/ventilation is common: Of 191 hospitalized patients, 103 (54%) developed respiratory failure, 59 31%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 41 (21%) received high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy, 26 (14%) received non-invasive mechanical ventilation, 32 (17%) received invasive mechanical ventilation, and 3 (2%) received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Of 187 hospitalized patients, 46 (24.6%) developed ARDS, with 45 (24.1%) requiring mechanical ventilation (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Basics of Mechanical Ventilation Common modalities for provision of supplemental oxygenation/ventilation include nasal cannula, facemask/nonrebreather, high-flow nasal cannula, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP), and invasive mechanical ventilation. Nasal cannula, facemask, and high-flow nasal cannula: function predominately by increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), to varying degress, depending on the flow and amount of mixing with room air, with minimal/modest effects on airway pressures CPAP, BiPAP, and Invasive Mechanical Ventilation: in addition to increasing the fraction of inspired oxygen, these modalities have the ability to alter airway pressures (to varying degrees). These modalities may have hemodynamic effects in addition to their effect on oxgenation/ventilation CPAP and BiPAP Both CPAP and BiPAP are non-invasive strategies that utilize masks or helmets to provide support to the patient, and may be used to treat hypoxia (CPAP/BiPAP), increased work of breathing (CPAP/BiPAP), and hypercarbic respiratory faulure (BiPAP) CPAP: allows the user to set FiO2 and the amount of continuous positive airway pressure, predominately functioning to improve oxygenation (and work of breathing) BiPAP: allows the user to set FiO2, inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP), and expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP). Increasing FiO2 and EPAP work to improve oxygenation. The pressure difference between IPAP and EPAP augments tidal volume, improving ventilation. Invasive Mechanical Ventilation Invasive mechanical ventilation utilizes an endotracheal tube and ventilator to provide invasive oxygenation/ventilation support to the patient. Several parameters are avialable to the user to manipulate both oxygenation and ventilation. At UPHS, the primary mode of ventilation for patients with ARDS is assist-control/volume-control, which allows the user to provide fully-supported breaths to the patient and guarantee a minimum minute-ventilation. Common settings Tidal Volume: the target tidal volume in ARDS is 6cc/kilogram of predicted body weight (based on the patient’s height). In combination with respiratory rate, tidal volume affects ventilation (and acid-base status). The target tidal volume is lower than in a spontaneously breathing patient to minimize volutrauma and ventilator-associated lung injury. Respiratory Rate: the respiratory rate (in combination with tidal volume) affects ventilation (and acid-base status). Because the initial tidal volume is low, the initial respiratory rate should be higher than normal in order to match the increased minute-ventilation requirements of critically-ill patients. Fraction of Inspired Oxygen (FiO2): FiO2 is often set initially at 100%, but should be titrated to goal peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) &gt;92% Positive End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP): PEEP allows the user to increase end-expiratory pressure to ensure alveoli remain open for gas exchange. When PEEP is set too low, alveoli may de-recruit with each breath, leading to atelectotrauma and ventilator-associated lung injury. When PEEP is set too high, alveoli may experience barotrauma and ventilator-associated lung injury. PEEP may also have hemodynamic effects. Monitoring parameters Pulse Oximetry/PaO2: The effectiveness of oxygen supplementation may be monitored peripherally with the use of pulse oximetry, or invasively with the use of an aterial blood gas and measurement of the partial pressure of dissolved oxygen. Goal peripheral oxygen saturation is typically &gt;92% (although may be lower in patient’s with underlying hypercarbic lung disease like COPD), and goal PaO2 55-80 mmHg. End-tidal CO2/PCO2: The effectiveness of ventilatory support may be monitored non-invasively with the use of an end-tidal CO2 monitor, or invasively using venous or arterial blood gases. Goal pH &gt;7.15 in ARDSnet trials, UPHS pH goal &gt;7.20. Plateau Pressure: To minimize ventilator-induced lung injury, the plateau pressure (measured using an inspiratory pause maneuver) should remain &lt;30 cm H2O. Minimizing Driving Pressure (difference between plateau pressure and PEEP) has been identified as a predictor of improved outcomes in ARDS. This can be acheived by asking a respiratory therapist to perform “PEEP titration” (adjusting PEEP to minimize driving pressure while keeping plateau pressure &lt;30 cm H2O).
