JAMA Cardiology 2020; Thygesen, et al., JACC, 2018) Diagnostics Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP ECG Consider limited echocardiogram Consider measurement of inflammatory markers to evaluate hyperinflammation (Ferritin, IL-6, LDH, D-dimer) Incidence 12% overall, 31% ICU, 4% non-ICU (among 41 patients total) (Huang, et al., Lancet, 2020) 17% overall (among 191 patients total) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) 19.7% overall (among 416 patients overall) (Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) 27.8% (n = 52) (among 187 patients overall) (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Prognostic Implications Associated with increased utilization of noninvasive ventilation (38 [46.3%] vs 13 [3.9%]; P &lt; .001) and invasive mechanical ventilation (18 [22.0%] vs 14 [4.2%]; P &lt; .001) (Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Associated with increased mortality Occured in 59% of non-survivors (N = 32) vs. 1% of survivors (N = 1) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Adjusted HR 4.26 [95% CI, 1.92-9.49] p &lt; 0.001) (Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Mortality 59.6% (n = 31) in individuals with ↑TnT vs. 8.9% (n = 12) with normal TnT; p &lt; 0.001 (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Possible interaction between underlying cardiovascular disease (CVD) and myocardial injury Mortality 7.62% (8 of 105) among patients without CVD + normal TnT, 13.33% (4 of 30) for underlying CVD + normal TnT levels, 37.50% (6 of 16) for those without underlying CVD + ↑TnT levels, and 69.44% (25 of 36) for underlying CVD + ↑TnT (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Treatment Considerations Supportive care If associated with concomittant hyperinflammation/cytokine storm/secondary HLH, consider anti-IL6 or anti-IL1 therapy (see Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release) Acute Coronary Syndrome Definition Acute myocardial injury detected by abnormal cardiac biomarkers in the setting of evidence of acute myocardial ischemia (Thygesen, et al., JACC, 2018) Must be differentiated from other causes of Acute Cardiac Injury Pathophysiology Myocardial ischemia as a consequence of atherothrombotic coronary artery disease (eg. plaque disruption; Type I MI), mismatch between oxygen supply and demand (Type II MI), in association with cardiac death (eg. Type III MI), related to percutaneous coronary intervention (Type IV MI), or associated with coronary artery bypass grafting (Type V MI) Incidence As of 3/2020, case reports of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (Type 1 MI) in the setting of COVID-19 have yet to be published (Driggin, et al., JACC, 2020) Severe respiratory has been identified as a risk factor for acute myocardial infarction Incidence ratio [IR] 6.1, 95% CI 3.9-9.5 following influenza; IR 2.8, 95% CI 1.2–6.2 following non-influenza viral illness (Kwong, et al., NEJM, 2018) Diagnostics Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, lipid screen, A1c ECG Consider limited echocardiogram Treatment Considerations (SCAI Guidelines) See Szerlip, et al., Catheterization and Cardiovascular Interventions, 2020, summarized below: STEMI Primary PCI for high risk patients (anterior location, hypotension, elevated Killip class, cardiogenic shock, life-threatening, delayed presentation &gt;12 hours) Consider fibrinolysis for low risk patients without contraindications (intracranial hemorrhage, prior stroke, recent trauma/surgery, intracranial malignancy/arteriovenous malformation/aneurysm, active bleeding, uncontrolled hypertension); otherwise consider primary PCI or medical management NSTEMI Early angiography (&lt;2 hours) for very high risk patients (refractory chest pain, heart failure, cardiogenic shock, life-threatening arrhythmia) Conservative management for non-very high risk patients with antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation (48 hours), high-intensity statin, beta-blocker, ACE-inhibitor (if indicated) Arrhythmia Incidence 16.7% (n = 23) overall; 44% (n = 16) of patients transferred to ICU (Wang, et al., JAMA, 2020) VT/VF in 5.9% (n = 11) (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Palpitations in 7.2% (n = 10) (Liu, et al., Chinese Medical Journal, 2020) Diagnostics BMP, magnesium, TSH Telemetry ECG Consider limited echocardiogram Treatment Considerations Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter No hypotension/shock: Beta blockade and/or calcium-channel blockade Hypotension/shock: Consider amiodarone infusion Ventricular Tachycardia Pulseless/Unstable: ACLS, defibrillation/cardioversion Stable: Consider amiodarone or lidocaine infusion Myo/Pericarditis Incidence Myocarditis and pericarditis may be sources of acute cardiac injury based on case reports, overall incidence unclear (Ruan et al, Intensive Care Med, 2020; Zeng et al, Preprints, 2020; Hu et al, Eur Heart J, 2020; Inciardi, et al., JAMA Cardiology 2020) No clear evidence of myocarditis on limited cardiac biopsy (Xu, et al., Lancet Respir Med, 2020) Diagnostics Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP ECG - case reports of pseudo-STEMI manifestations Consider limited echocardiogram Unclear role of endomyocardial biopsy and/or cardiac MRI Management Supportive treatment; consider colchicine, NSAIDs Anecdotal/case reports above describe treatment with steroids and IVIG in Wuhan Thromboembolic Disease/Coagulopathy Incidence Mild thrombocytopenia (platelets 100-150) in 20% (n = 13) (Fan, et al., American Journal of Hematology, 2020) Coaguloapthy in 34.1% (n = 42) (Guo, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Coagulopathy (defined as 3-second extension of PT or a 5-second extension of aPTT) in 19% (n = 37) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Diagnostics D-dimer, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, peripheral smear/manual differential Prognostic Implications Elevated D-dimer levels (&gt;1g/L) associated with in-hospital death (adjusted OR 18.4 95% CI 2.6-128.6, p=0.003) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Coagulopathy present in 50% (n = 27) of non-survivors vs. 7% (n = 10) in survivors (p &lt;0.001) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Disseminated intravascular coagulation present in 71.4% (n = 15) of non-survivors vs. 0.6% (n = 1) in survivors (Tang, et al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020) Treatment Considerations VTE prophylaxis in all hospitalized patients with COVID-19 A retrospective study in China of 449 consecutive cases of severe COVID-19 showed benefit of LMWH in patients with high D-Dimer, PT times, and Sepsis Induced Coagulopathy score &gt; 4 (Tang, et al., Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020) Current ISTH proposed guidelines suggest prophylactic anticoagulation with LMWH (Thachil et al, Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis, 2020) Secondary Hemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis/Cytokine Release Definition Hyperinflammatory syndrome characterised by macrophage activation and fulminant hypercytokinemia, associated with multiorgan failure and shock. Clinical Presentation Fever, splenomegaly, cytopenias, and hyperferritinemia, with progression to ARDS in 54% (Seguin, et al., Chest, 2016) May be associated with Acute Cardiac Injury (Zheng, et al., Nat Rev Cardiol, 2020) Incidence Unclear incidence/prevalence in COVID-19, although a similar pattern of dysregulated immune response has been reported (Mehta et al, Lancet, 2020) Similar response identified in SARS-CoV-1 and MERS infections (Kim et al, J Korean Med Sci, 2016) Occurs in 3.7-4.3% of patients with sepsis (Karakike, et al., Frontiers in Immunology, 2020) Diagnostics CBC with differential, PT/INR, aPTT, fibrinogen, D-dimer, ferritin, hepatic function panel, triglycerides, inflammatory markers (ESR/CRP); consider NK-function, soluble IL-2 receptor in discussion with hematology/oncology Calculate H-score (MDcalc) Prognostic Implications Associated with rapid progression to ARDS, shock, and multiorgan failure (Chen et al, Lancet, 2020) Treatment Considerations Care typically supportive Consideration of IVIG, steroids (may be associated with worsened lung injury), enrollment in clinical trial (or off-label use) of cytokine blockade (IL-6 antagonists [eg. tocilizumab, sarilumab] or IL-1 antagonists [eg. anakinra]) Cardiomyopathy/Heart Failure/Cardiogenic Shock Incidence 23% overall (n = 44) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) 33% (n = 7) of ICU patients in Washington State (Arentz et al., JAMA, 2020) Diagnostics Physical Exam: ↑JVP/CVP, edema, rales/crackles Pulse pressure &lt; 25% of SBP correlates highly with cardiac index &lt; 2.2 (sensitivity 91%, specificity 83%) (Stevenson and Perloff, JAMA, 1989) Labs: Cardiac troponin, NT-proBNP, lactate, central/mixed venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2) if available ECG Chest x-ray Consider limited echocardiogram Prognostic Implications Chronic heart failure associated with increased risk of acute cardiac injury (14.6% vs. 1.5%) (Shi, et al., JAMA Cardiology, 2020) Associated with increased risk of mortality, more common in non-survivors (52%, n = 28) vs. survivors (12%, n = 16) (Zhou, et al., Lancet, 2020) Management Stable/Chronic Goal-directed medical therapy with beta-blockade, ACE/ARB/ARNI, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ESC and HFSA/ACC/AHA recommend continuation of ACE/ARB/ARNI. See Medication Considerations Unstable/Cardiogenic Shock Consider invasive hemodynamic monitoring with arterial and central venous catheters Goals: MAPs 65-75, CVP 6-14, PCWP 12-18, PAD 20-25, SVR 800-1000, SCvO2 &gt; 60%, CI &gt; 2.2 (Note: Achieving MAP goal is first priority, then optimize other parameters) Ensure negative inotropes such as beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and antihypertensives are discontinued. Titration of norepinephrine infusion for goal MAP 65-75 Initiate diuretic therapy for CVP &gt; 14, PCWP &gt;18, PAD &gt; 25 Consider inotropic support (eg. dobutamine or epinephrine infusions) Medication Considerations ACE/ARB/ARNI See reviews: Vaduganathan et al., NEJM, 2020 and Patel et al., JAMA 2020 Pathophysiology Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) serves as the entry point for SARS-CoV-2 into human cells ACE2 is expressed in many tissues, including in the heart and kidneys, and lung alveolar epithelial cells (Hamming, et al., J Pathol, 2004) Under normal conditions lung ACE2 expression is low (Serfozo, Hypertension, 2020), but may be upregulated in infection Pharmacologic modulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may alter ACE2 levels ACE inhibitors in humans do not appear to affect ACE2 activity. These drugs specifically target ACE, which has a different active site than ACE2 (Rice, et al., Biochem J, 2004) Potential Harms There is conflicting evidence, but in some animal models, both angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have been shown to upregulate ACE2 expression in the heart, raising concern that these medications may increase susceptibility to COVID-19 through increased SARS-CoV-2 viral entry. (Patel et al., JAMA 2020) Potential Benefits Withdrawal of ACE/ARB and other goal-directed medical therapy in patients with heart failure is associated with worsening symptoms (Pflugfelder, et al., JACC, 1993; Halliday, et al., Lancet, 2019) Early initiation of ACE-inhbitors following myocardial infarction/acute coronary syndrome is associated with improved outcomes (Circulation, 1998) Currently, there is no clinical evidence that ACE/ARB/ARNI are associated with increased risk of COVID-19. Preclinical models have suggested ARBs may attenuate SARS-CoV-induced lung injury (Kuba, et al., Nature Medicine, 2005) Recommendation ESC and HFSA/ACC/AHA recommend continuation of ACE/ARB/ARNI. NSAIDs Pathophysiology NSAIDs suppress prostaglandin synthases 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), enzymes responsible for producing prostaglandins (lipids which can trigger pain and fever) Potential Harms SARS-CoV-1 binds to the COX-2 promotor, increasing expression of this enzyme. (Yan, et al., Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol., 2006). Because PGE2 may inhibit coronavirus replication (Amici et al., Antivir. Ther., 2006), there is theoretical concern that NSAID-mediated decreases in PGE2 may increase risk of COVID-19. NSAIDs may increase risk of cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal ulcer/bleeding, and acute kidney injury, among others Potential Benefits Indomethacin may block coronavirus RNA synthesis independent of COX inhibition (Sander et al., Front. Physiol, 2017) Recommendation There is no strong clinical evidence for or against the use of NSAIDs in individuals with (or at-risk-of) SARS-CoV-2 infection (Fitzgerald, Science, 2020), although other patient-specific factors (risk of cardiovascular events, gastrointestinal ulcers/bleeding, chronic kidney disease) should be considered. Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine See review: Simpson, et al., ACC.org, 2020 Toxicity Cardiovascular: Atrioventricular block, bundle branch block, cardiac arrhythmia, cardiomyopathy, ECG changes (including prolonged QRS and QTc intervals, T-wave inversion, or depression), hypotension, torsades de pointes, ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia (UpToDate) Ophthalmologic: toxicity is uncommon with short-term use; long-term use associated with retinal toxicity Monitoring ECG (baseline QTc) Consider telemetry Azithromycin See review: Simpson, et al., ACC.org, 2020 Toxicity Altered cardiac conduction: QTc prolongation, ventricular arrhythmias, torsades de pointes; consider avoiding use in patients with prolonged QT interval, congenital long QT syndrome, history of torsades de pointes, bradyarrhythmias, uncorrected hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia, clinically significant bradycardia, uncompensated heart failure, or concurrent use of Class IA (eg, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (eg, amiodarone, dofetilide, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents or other drugs known to prolong the QT interval.
